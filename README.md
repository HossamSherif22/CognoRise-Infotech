### About the Internship
At CognoRise Infotech, our internship program is designed to provide hands-on experience in various technology fields, such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web Development, and more. The goal is to enhance your practical skills while working on real-world projects with industry experts.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: Git
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

### Prerequisites
Before starting the internship, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python or JavaScript
- Understanding of version control (Git)
- Familiarity with web development frameworks (Django, React, etc.)
- Access to a GitHub account

4. Set up the development environment as per the project's instructions.

### Projects
During this internship, you'll be working on the following projects:

1. **IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**:
    The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and
    virginica.
    • These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine possessing
    measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.
    • The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these
    measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding
    species.
    • Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into
    distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
    • This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it
    ideal for introductory learning experiences

2. **CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**:
    • Develop a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card
      transactions.
    • The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing
      class imbalance concerns, and partitioning the dataset into training and testing
      subsets.
    • Train a classification algorithm—like logistic regression or random forests—to
      differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
    • Assess the model's efficacy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
    • Additionally, explore strategies like oversampling or undersampling to enhance
      outcomes and refine the model's performance.
   
3. **TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**:
    • Utilize the Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining if a
      passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
    • This project serves as an introductory exercise, offering accessible data for analysis.
    • The dataset comprises passenger details encompassing age, gender, ticket class,
      fare, cabin, and survival outcome.
    • By applying this data, you can embark on a classic project that provides insights
      into survival patterns among Titanic passengers.

4. **SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION**:
    • Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for
    predictions and other characteristics of the data.
    • It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on
    previous observations.
    • It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather data,
    stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.
